        <p>A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...</p>
        <p>It's the resistance biggest stand.</p>
        <p>
          After the sacrifice of the Jedi Knight, Ben Kenobi in the rescue of Princess Leia Organa Luke Skywalker join the resistance in a desperate attack against the terrible DEATH STAR, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.
        </p>
        <p>A new hope was born in this attack. 
          Thanks to the plans obtained by the Rogue One team the resistance discovered 
          the weapon's only weak point: a little spot in the thermal exhaust system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only a proton torpedo at the exact point can do the job. 
          Will the resistance be able to survive the attack and destroy the Death Star?
